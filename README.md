This repository contains my implementation of the vision transformer ([Dosovitskiy et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)). It is based on the [Vision Transformers from Scratch (PyTorch): A Step by Step Guide](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/vision-transformers-from-scratch-pytorch-a-step-by-step-guide-96c3313c2e0c) tutorial, which I used as an example to better understand how transformers work, and to which I added my own improvements.
